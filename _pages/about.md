I‚Äôm currently a Researcher at [SenseTime Japan Ltd](https://www.sensetime.jp/) („Çª„É≥„Çπ„Çø„Ç§„É†„Ç∏„É£„Éë„É≥), where I work on deep learning and computer vision related to autonomous driving technology. I received my PhD degree from the Graduate School of IST, [the University of Tokyo](https://www.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index.shtml) in March, 2023, advised by Prof. [Shin'ichi Satoh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=7aEF5cQAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). Before that, I receive my Master's degrees from the University of Tokyo in 2020 and the bachelor‚Äôs degree from Shandong University in 2016. 

**Research interest:** Object detection / segmentation related to autonomous driving, image retrieval and metric learning. *If you are seeking any form of academic cooperation or [intership](https://www.sensetime.jp/joinus/internship), please feel free to email me at [zengzelong@sensetime.jp](zengzelong@sensetime.jp)*
